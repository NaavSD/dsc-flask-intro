    "\n",
    "### Client\n",
    "\n",
    "The client makes the **request** and waits for the **response**. Probably the most familiar HTTP client is a web browser. We have also previously used the `requests` library to make a Python code client.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Server\n",
    "\n",
    "The server runs constantly, waiting for requests, and then responds to requests when it receives them. Most of the time as a data scientist you will be interacting with a server that someone else is managing. However in this lesson we'll learn how to run a server of our own!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Web Server\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we're specifically looking at a **web server** called Flask. Not all servers are web servers (e.g. database servers are a different kind of server), but web servers are a particularly valuable tool because they allow resources and services to be accessed via the Internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web servers accept requests and serve responses with an **HTTP protocol**. This protocol means that the client and server can operate using totally different languages, and easily interact so long as they use the right HTTP methods, paths, headers, and responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll set up:\n",
    "\n",
    "* HTTP `GET` method\n",
    "  * Used by clients to request to read some form of data from the server\n",
    "  * Corresponds to the `.get()` method in the `requests` library\n",
    "* `/` path\n",
    "  * Essentially asking for the \"home page\" of the website\n",
    "* No particular headers\n",
    "* A string response"
